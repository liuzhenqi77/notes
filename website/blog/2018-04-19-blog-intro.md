Welcome to my new 'notes' website.

<!--truncate-->

I made the site as a replacement of my notes on GitBook.com, as its new product goes commercial and thus lacks self-hosting possibilities. The setups are mainly completed on 2018/04/20-2018/04/21, and going online around the same time. The site will be hosted on Github Pages, unless I find it necessary to host alongside my personal website on the VPS someday. And thanks to docusaurus.io for providing the wonderful open-source project.
